The time required for servicing transmissions is normally distributed with μ = 45 minutes and σ = 8 minutes. 
The service manager plans to have work begin on the transmission of a customer’s car 10 minutes after 
the car is dropped off and the customer 
is told that the car will be ready within 1 hour from drop-off. 
What is the probability that the service manager cannot meet his commitment?
